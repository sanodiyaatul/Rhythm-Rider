This project is a fun and interactive drum kit that you can play right in your web browser.
Whether you're a drummer looking for a digital practice tool, a music enthusiast exploring rhythms,
or a developer interested in web audio and interactivity, this drum kit has something for everyone.

I used HTML,CSS,JavaScript for this project.
